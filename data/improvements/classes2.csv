Extract constants,There are many magic numbers and strings in the code. These should be extracted into named constants to improve readability and maintainability.,Replace Magic values with constants.
Remove redundant else condition,The last else condition is redundant. The code inside it can be placed outside the condition. This will simplify the code and make it easier to understand.,Remove Statements.
Use StringBuilder instead of StringBuffer,"StringBuilder is faster when the buffer is not shared among multiple threads, because it does not synchronize every operation like StringBuffer does.",Use StringBuilder instead of <>.
Use a guard clause instead of nested ifs,"Instead of using nested if statements, you can use a guard clause to make the code easier to read by returning early if the container is not supported.",Other.
Replace magic strings with constants,"The method contains many magic strings (i.e., string literals with unexplained meaning). Replacing these with named constants would make the code more readable and maintainable.",Replace Magic values with constants.
Use appropriate HTTP status codes,The code uses HTTP 200 OK status for all types of exceptions which is not appropriate. It should use appropriate HTTP status codes based on the type of the exception.,Improve Exception handling.
Avoid null checks,"Null checks can lead to Null Pointer Exceptions. Instead, use Optional to avoid null checks.",Use <method> instead of null check.
Remove redundant System.currentTimeMillis() call,The call to System.currentTimeMillis() does not affect the program and should be removed.,Remove Statements.

Extract duplicate code into a method,There are multiple occurrences of the same block of code that checks if the path is a collection type and throws an exception if it is. This duplicate code can be extracted into a separate method to adhere to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.,Extract code blocks into separate method.
Reduce Redundant Code,The code has redundant try-catch blocks where the same operations are performed sequentially. This can be improved by creating a helper method to encapsulate the try-catch block and the operation being performed. This would make the code more readable and maintainable.,Extract code blocks into separate method.
Move ApiConfig configuration to a separate method,The initialization and configuration of the ApiConfig object inside the test method makes it long and hard to read. This could be moved to a separate method to improve readability and reusability.,Extract code blocks into separate method.

Use switch-case instead of multiple if-else,"Instead of using multiple if-else statements to check the style of operation, use a switch-case. This would make the code more readable and also slightly faster.",Use switch statement.
Combine the two if conditions regarding container,The two if conditions checking whether container is an instance of Connection and whether container's class name ends with 'Connection' can be combined into a single if condition using an OR operator.,Other.
Extract common anonymous class creation to a method,"The anonymous class creation of DataFetcherFactory is duplicated for both executors and reactiveExecutors. You can extract this to a method and reuse it, reducing code duplication.",Extract code blocks into separate method.
Replace concatenation with StringBuilder in loop,"When doing concatenation inside a loop, it would be more efficient to use StringBuilder. String concatenation with '+' in a loop causes performance issues because each concatenation generates a new String object.",Use StringBuilder instead of <>.
Use Logger instead of System.out.println,"Instead of using System.out.println to output error messages, use a Logger. This makes it easier to manage and control the output of the program.",Use <method-1> method instead of <method-2>.
Avoid assigning a value more than once to a field,It is not good practice to assign a value more than once to a field. It can make the code hard to read and maintain. A better approach would be to use a local variable and then assign the result to the field just once at the end of the method.,Other.
Use methods of java.util.Iterator,"Instead of manually handling the iteration, you can use hasNext() and next() methods of java.util.Iterator. This not only reduces the amount of code but also makes it more readable.",Use <method-1> method instead of <method-2>.
"Use try-with-resources for Connection, PreparedStatement and ResultSet","The try-with-resources statement is a try statement that declares one or more resources. The resource objects must implement the java.lang.AutoCloseable interface or the java.io.Closeable interface. When the try block completes, whether normally or abruptly, all the resources declared are automatically closed. This ensures that the resources are always closed and can prevent resource leaks.",Use try-with-resources.
Improve code readability by reducing nesting,The method has deep nesting which makes the code less readable. It is better to split it into multiple small methods or use early returns to flatten the structure.,Extract code blocks into separate method.
Extract duplicate code into a method,The code inside the two for loops is identical except for the type of executor. This duplicate code could be extracted into a new method.,Extract code blocks into separate method.
Avoid code duplication,There are similar blocks of code in the method that can be extracted into a separate method to avoid duplication.,Extract code blocks into separate method.
Extract logic in retry method into a separate method,The logic inside the retry method is complex and specific. It's better to extract this logic into a separate method. This makes the code cleaner and easier to understand.,Extract code blocks into separate method.
Use constants for repeated values,"The value '2' is used multiple times in the code. It is a good practice to replace such literals with named constants. This makes the code more readable and maintainable. If the value needs to be changed in the future, it can be done in one place.",Replace Magic values with constants.
Use enhanced for loop instead of Iterator,"Instead of using an Iterator to loop over `appenderList`, use the enhanced for loop. The enhanced for loop is easier to read and reduces the chance of programming errors.",Use enhanced for loop.
Remove redundant semicolon,There is a redundant semicolon after the try-catch block. It's not needed and can be removed.,Remove Statements.
Avoid magic numbers,"The code contains magic numbers (like 0, 1). It's better to replace them with named constants to make the code more readable and maintainable.",Replace Magic values with constants.
Use try-with-resources for StringBuilder,"To ensure that StringBuilder is closed after being used, it's better to use a try-with-resources statement. This avoids potential memory leaks or other issues related to resource management.",Use try-with-resources.
Use try-with-resources to automatically close resources,"Instead of manually closing resources in a finally block, use Java's try-with-resources feature. This ensures that each resource is closed at the end of the statement, which makes the code cleaner and less error-prone.",Use try-with-resources.
Remove redundant initialization of result,The 'result' variable is initialized with null but this is not necessary because it's assigned in all branches of the switch statement.,Remove Statements.
Remove unnecessary else block,"The 'else' block after the 'if' conditions that check if the element is an instance of HtmlDialog is unnecessary. If the 'if' condition is true, the method returns, so the 'else' block will not be executed. If the 'if' condition is false, the program will naturally continue to the next lines, rendering the 'else' keyword superfluous.",Remove Statements.
Avoid empty catch blocks,"Empty catch blocks can lead to swallowing exceptions and making it hard to debug when something goes wrong. At the very least, log the exception.",Improve Exception handling.
Replace explicit type with <>,"In Java 7 and later, you can replace the parameterized type of the constructor with an empty set of type parameters (<>).",Use diamond operator.
Use try-with-resources for time measurement,"To accurately measure the time taken by 'JMeterBuilder.buildApiDoc(config)', use a try-with-resources block with a custom AutoCloseable timer resource. This ensures that the timer is stopped even if an exception is thrown, providing a more accurate measurement.",Use try-with-resources.
Avoid code repetition,"There is a lot of code repetition in the current method. The same block of code is duplicated multiple times, once for each combination of 'n1', 'n2', 'lgK1', 'lgK2', and 'lgMaxK'. These repeated lines of code can be extracted into a new method, which can then be called with the required parameters.",Extract code blocks into separate method.
Use Optional instead of null check,"Java 8 introduced Optional to help design more comprehensible APIs so that by just reading the signature of a method, you can tell whether you can expect an optional value. This forces you to actively unwrap an Optional to deal with the absence of a value.",Use <method> instead of null check.
Extract node creation to a separate method,The creation of a new Node within the for loop can be extracted to a separate method. This would make the code more readable and would also separate the concerns of node creation and node linking.,Extract code blocks into separate method.
Use try-catch block to handle ClassCastException,The code makes a lot of unchecked casts which can lead to ClassCastException. We can add a try-catch block to handle these exceptions and provide meaningful error messages.,Improve Exception handling.
Use JUnit's assertThrows instead of try-catch-fail pattern,"The current code uses a try-catch pattern with a fail statement for testing exceptions, which is not recommended. Instead, use JUnit's assertThrows method, which is more concise and expressive.",Use <method-1> method instead of <method-2>.
Replace multiple string concatenations with append,"String concatenation in a loop is inefficient because it creates a new string object at every concatenation. Instead, use the StringBuilder append method, which is more efficient.",Use StringBuilder instead of <>.
Avoid null assignment,Assigning 'null' to 'counterMap' after clearing it is not necessary. Java's garbage collector will clean up the object once there are no more references to it.,Remove Statements.
