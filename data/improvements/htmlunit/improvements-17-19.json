                "Description": "The method type() is coupled to many other objects such as HtmlForm, WebClient, HtmlSubmitInput, and HtmlPage. We can reduce this coupling by making these objects class members and initializing them in the constructor or in a different method. This will make the type() method easier to read and maintain.",

                "Change_Diff": "N/A",
                "Description": "The method type() is very long and does many things, which makes it hard to understand and maintain. We can split it into smaller methods, each doing one thing. For example, we can have a method that handles the shift key, another that handles the key down event, another that handles the key press event, etc.",

                "Change_Diff": "N/A",
                "Description": "The instanceof operator is used to check if this is an instance of HtmlTextInput, HtmlTextArea, HtmlTelInput, HtmlNumberInput, HtmlSearchInput, or HtmlPasswordInput. This goes against the Open-Closed Principle of object-oriented design, which states that a class should be open for extension but closed for modification. A better approach would be to use polymorphism and make these classes implement an interface that has a method fireEvent(), and then call this method on this.",

                "Change_Diff": "N/A",
                "Description": "The variable shiftDown and shiftDownResult are defined and assigned a value only when isShiftNeeded is true. However, they are not used anywhere else in the code. Therefore, these variables should be removed.",
