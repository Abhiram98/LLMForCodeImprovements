Changing the variable name 'apis' to 'apiList' and 'methodApi' to 'api' for better code readability and understanding.,Use meaningful variable names,"Improve variable name(s).
"
"When you have a variable which can assume a limited set of values and you want to execute some code depending on its value, instead of having a long if...else if...else if sequence, switch-case is more appropriate and readable.",Use switch-case instead of multiple if-else,"Use switch statement.
"
"Strings like 'HistoryTest_a.html', 'HistoryTest_b.html', 'HistoryTest_c.html' etc are used more than once. It would be better to declare them as constants at the beginning of the method or as class constants if they are used in other methods as well.",Declare constants for repeated strings,"Replace Magic values with constants.
"
"The Deprecated annotation is used to inform the compiler that the particular method, class, or field is deprecated and it may be removed in the future versions. If this method is still in use, it's better to remove the @Deprecated annotation.",Remove Deprecated annotation,"Remove Statements/Expressions.
"
Using a switch-case statement can make the code more readable and efficient when we have multiple conditions based on the same variable. It is especially true when we are checking for character ranges.,Use switch-case instead of multiple if-else conditions,"Use switch statement.
"
"If `builder.getApiConfig().getRequestBodyAdvice()` produces a potentially leaky resource such as a stream or database connection, it should be handled with a try-with-resources block to ensure it is properly closed even in the case of an exception.",Use try-with-resources for potentially leaky resource,"Use try-with-resources.
"
A try-catch block can be used to handle exceptions that may be thrown by the method calls within the block. This can prevent the program from terminating unexpectedly.,Use try-catch block to handle exceptions,"Improve Exception handling.
"
There's no need to explicitly compare a boolean value with true or false. It makes the code more verbose and less readable.,Remove explicit comparison with boolean,"Use Lambda expressions.
"
"Instead of using System.out.println and System.err.println for logging, use a proper logging framework like java.util.logging or log4j. This will provide more control over the logging levels and the output destinations.",Use logger instead of System.out.println and System.err.println,"Use <method-1> method instead of <method-2>.
"
"StringBuilder is faster when the buffer is not shared among multiple threads, because it does not synchronize every operation like StringBuffer does.",Use StringBuilder instead of StringBuffer,"Use StringBuilder instead of <>.
