                "Description": "The current method catches all exceptions and just prints their stack trace. This approach is not considered good practice as it can be difficult to understand the nature of the exception. The sleep method can throw an InterruptedException which should be properly handled. It's best to catch this exception separately and handle it in a way that makes sense for your application.",
