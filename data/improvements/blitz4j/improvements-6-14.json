                "Description": "Instead of catching a general Exception, catch a more specific exception, InterruptedException. This is because Thread.sleep() throws an InterruptedException, and it's a best practice to catch as specific exceptions as possible.",

Its use can make the behavior of your application unnecessarily nondeterministic and difficult to debug. So, it's better to remove it.",
